        <h1>Orange Rosemary Pork with Stir Fry Peppers</h1>

<p>A coworker had an abundance of rosemary growing at home, and
brought some to work to share with everyone. I took a bit home, not
sure what I was going to cook with it. By combining it with what I had
at home at the time (hence the reference to the pre-packaged peppers),
and using a few different recipes off the Internet, I came up with
this dinner. The sweetness of the orange counterbalances the taste of
rosemary, and the whole thing has a kind of sweet-and-sour Chinese
taste to it. Fair warning: portions and ingredients are most
definitely not exact.</p>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 pork chops.</li>
<li>A few tablespoons coarsely chopped rosemary (fresh, in this case)</li>
<li>Salt and Pepper (to taste)</li>
<li>Cooked rice</li>
<li>1 package Bird's Eye Pepper Stir-Fry (found in the freezer section of the local grocery)</li>
<li>About 1/3 cup cooking wine</li>
<li>About 1/2-3/4 cup orange juice</li>
</ul>

<h2>Method:</h2>
<p>Combine the chopped rosemary, salt, and pepper, and rub onto both
sides of the pork chops. With a skillet on medium-high heat, cook the
pork chops until cooked, about 5 minutes on each side. Set the chops
aside (covered so as to keep them warm), then stir fry the pepper mix
in the already-hot skillet. After the mix is cooked (about when the
onions are starting to caramelize and turn translucent), take all but
about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of the mix out of the skillet. With the skillet
still going, toss in the wine and the orange juice. Scrape all of the
flavorful little brown bits and cooked onions and peppers off of the
skillet, and stir the sauce. It should start to boil almost
immediately, and you want to keep it boiling until it is reduced to
proper consistency. It doesn't hurt during a part of this to toss the
pork back in for a bit, on each side.</p>

<h2>Plating:</h2>
<p>Make a bed of the cooked rice on one side, and spoon the pepper mix
on top of it. Plate the pork next to the rice on the other side of the
plate, and then pour the orange sauce on top of it. Serve.</p>

<p>In this case, feeds two.</p>
