        <h1>S&amp;P Downgrade</h1><div class="blog-header"><p>Posted on August 7, 2011</p></div><p>
The actual impact of the downgrade of the U.S. credit rating by S&amp;P is
proportional to the amount of trust that the markets have in S&amp;P as a
ratings agency.  More accurately, when asking the question <q>"Will the
U.S. pay back this debt?"</q>, buyers of Treasury bonds must decide who
they trust more: Standard &amp; Poors or the United States Congress.
Anything beyond that is just bare politicking.
</p>

<p>
Let's look at S&amp;P first. Robert Reich has aptly <a
href="http://robertreich.org/post/8542550924">pointed out</a> that S&amp;P itself
is at least partially responsible for our current economic mess due to
its ineptitude as a ratings agency.  Its record during, say, the past
10 years is not particularly inspiring, given that phrases like
"collateralized debt obligation" and "mortgage-backed
securities" have entered the general lexicon.
To put this in perspective, S&amp;P is saying with this downgrade that a
10-year Treasury note today is more
risky than a C.D.O. or mortgage-backed security was in 2007.  This is laughable at best and
maliciously misleading at worse.  The market as a whole seems to
agree; in the week leading up to the downgrade, during which S&amp;P was
telegraphing the move every chance it got, the yield on that same note
<a
href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-04/treasuries-remain-higher-as-initial-jobless-claims-signal-slowing-economy.html">
fell to crazy lows (down to 2.4% at one point)</a> in a "flight to safety" by the market.
</p>

<p>
It is notable that, even with the nearly diametrically opposed 
Democrat and Republican positions, it was not even a topic of debate that the
U.S. will pay its creditors.  The Republican (and especially the Tea
Party) position, as stated, is that we must get spending under control
<em>precisely because</em> we must pay back all of the accumulated debt.  On the
other side, a Democratic president was preparing the bureaucracy to
<a
href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704013604576246612535953974.html">
furlough nearly half of the nation's federal workers and delay
payments to military servicemen and retirees, among other actions,</a> so that creditors can
have first dibs at a newly-limited pile of cash.
</p>

<p>
Not that Congress is blameless in all of this.  Far from it.
</p>

<p>
There is
absolutely no need for a debt ceiling and the associated debate.
Even if I sympathize that the government must cut spending and
live within its means, the time to make those decisions is when
legislating the budget.  After the budget has been signed into law,
we've collectively incurred the costs and therefore must take on the associated
debts; after the budget, it's all
just down to the bookkeeping.  The time to
figure out how to pay for the shiny new car is before you
sign on the dotted line, not after you've driven it around and the bill comes due.
</p>

<p>
This entire mess was a utterly manufactured "crisis" so that <b>both
parties</b> can hold the economy hostage in an attempt to get the upper hand
politically.  It was a self-inflicted wound.  And, make no mistake, it
was a self-inflicted wound that we did not avoid, even though we ended
up with a deal. It really has nothing to do with the rating, but S&amp;P
kinda has a point.  U.S. politics is broken.  Global faith in our
ability to work together to Get Things Done has been irreparably shaken.
International players will now question our stewardship of the world's
reserve currency and will seek to minimize our impact on the global
economy.  Businesses, already nervous given the current
economy, will continue to look elsewhere to make investments and will
know not to rely on U.S. help if the economy goes into a
double-dip recession.  The U.S. population has been provided the starkest
example yet its elected representatives are capable of
completely taking their eyes off the ball, and
are indeed eager to, for the smallest perceived political gain.  We
have been provided the starkest example yet that they represent
themselves, not us.  And we have been provided the starkest example
yet that the entire lot is just plain incapable and inept.
