        <h1>Romney on Immigration</h1><div class="blog-header"><p>Posted on January 28, 2012</p></div><p>Mitt Romney was asked about his views on immigration as part of the umpteenth 
presidential debate on January 26. His <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Q3J01fg-_s">quote</a>:</p>
<div class="quote"><p>
"Mr. Speaker, I'm not anti-immigrant. My father was born in Mexico. My
wife's father was born in Wales. They came to this country. The idea
that I'm anti-immigrant is repulsive."
</p>
</div>
<p>So, the implication here is that Romney is the son of an immigrant, and therefore is 
pro-immigration.</p>

<h2>Romney is not the son of an immigrant</h2>

<p>As NPR <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/01/27/145987534/why-could-romneys-father-run-for-president-if-he-was-born-in-mexico">reported</a> 
yesterday, Romney's father also ran for President. <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii#section1">Article II, Section 1 
of the U.S. Constitution</a> states that the President must be a natural-born citizen. Romney's father 
was able to run because he was the son of U.S. citizens, making him a natural-born U.S. citizen. He was not an immigrant, and
so Romney pointing at his father's Mexican birth as part of a discussion about immigration is misleading and disingenuous.
</p>

<h2>Romney is blatantly anti-(illegal)-immigration</h2>

<p>During the exchange, Romney said <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/election-2012/mitt-romney-favors-self-deportation-asked-immigration-gop-debate-article-1.1010812">
his answer</a> to illegal immigration was "self-deportation." While that sounds innocuous on the surface,
what he is really saying is that he wants to make jobs so scarce and life so terrible for illegal immigrants
that they would rather 
<a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106491521">make 
only a few dollars a day in their home country</a>
or
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/sep/21/mexico-35-bodies-dumped-road">go 
live in what is essentially a war zone</a>
than stay in the United States. The problem with that approach is that being a thief or other criminal
in the U.S. is preferable to poverty or death in another country, so all this policy would do is push
productive workers to be out-and-out criminals. And, that doesn't include the laws and bureaucracy that 
citizens and legal immigrants would need to put up with to make the U.S. inhospitable to illegal immigrants.</p>

<h2>If it looks like a politician and quacks like a politician, ...</h2>

<p>During this exchange, Romney brought in completely unrelated "evidence"
for why he is pro-(legal)-immigration when answering a question about illegal immigration, 
and then attempted to seize the moral high ground by painting 
himself the victim.  Romney has made the point repeatedly that he is not a career politician. He certainly acts
like one, though.</p>
